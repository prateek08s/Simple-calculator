# Simple-calculator
I created a basic calculator with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I styled it with CSS to make it seem clean, straightforward, and easy to use. The logic for the calculations is handled by JavaScript code.
